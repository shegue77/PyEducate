We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. Our Standards Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include: Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community Examples of unacceptable behavior include: The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks Public or private harassment Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting Enforcement Responsibilities Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate. Scope This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Enforcement Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Enforcement Guidelines Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct: 1. Correction Community Impact : Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community. Consequence : A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested. 2. Warning Community Impact : A violation through a single incident or series of actions. Consequence : A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban. 3. Temporary Ban Community Impact : A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior. Consequence : A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.

See the Table of Contents for different ways to help and details about how this project handles them. Please make sure to read the relevant section before making your contribution. It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers and smooth out the experience for all involved. The community looks forward to your contributions. \ud83c\udf89 And if you like the project, but just don't have time to contribute, that's fine. There are other easy ways to support the project and show your appreciation , which we would also be very happy about: - Star the project \u2b50 - Tweet about it - Refer this project in your project's readme - Mention the project at local meetups and tell your friends/colleagues \ud83d\udce2 Table of Contents I Have a Question I Want To Contribute Reporting Bugs Suggesting Enhancements & New Features What To Contribute I Have a Question Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing Issues that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first. If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following: Open an Issue . Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into. Provide project and platform versions, depending on what seems relevant. We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible. I Want To Contribute Submitting a PR Contributor License Agreement (CLA) Before contributing code to PyEducate, you must sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) . This is a legal requirement for all contributions to be merged into the main repository. Important: We strongly recommend reviewing and signing the CLA before starting work on your contribution to avoid any delays in the PR process. 1. Setup Your Local Development Environment # Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/shegue77/PyEducate.git cd PyEducate # Create new branch git checkout -b your-feature-branch # Install dependencies pip install -r requirements.txt # Install testing dependencies pip install -r requirements-dev.txt That's it! Your local development environment is ready. 2. Development Workflow Here's the recommended workflow for making changes: # Make your changes to the code # ... # Run tests black . # Reformats your code to make style clearer (Required) mypy . # Checks for any type hint errors (Required) flake8 . # Checks for any other issues (Optional but recommended) # Commit your changes git add . git commit -m \"Your descriptive commit message\" # Push and create a PR git push origin your-feature-branch Reporting Bugs Before Submitting a Bug Report A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible. Make sure that you are using the latest version. Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (If you are looking for support, you might want to check this section ). To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the bug tracker . Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue. Collect information about the bug: OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM) Version of the interpreter, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant. Possibly your input and the output Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions? How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report? You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent via Github's Security feature. We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project: Open an Issue . (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.) Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior. Please provide as much context as possible and describe the reproduction steps that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case. Provide the information you collected in the previous section. Once it's filed: The project team will label the issue accordingly. A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as needs-repro . Bugs with the needs-repro tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced. If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked needs-fix , as well as possibly other tags (such as critical ), and the issue will be left to be implemented by someone. Suggesting Enhancements This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for PyEducate, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality . Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions. Before Submitting an Enhancement Make sure that you are using the latest version. Perform a search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library. How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion? Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues . Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion. Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible. Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you. You may want to include screenshots or screen recordings which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most PyEducate users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

Once received, lessons are stored locally on the client\u2019s device, allowing learners to revisit them anytime \u2014 even without an active connection. \ud83d\udca1 In short: You create lessons on the host machine \u2192 the server program manages and serves them \u2192 clients connect to receive lessons instantly and interactively.","title":"\u2753 How It Works"},{"location":"Installation.html","text":"Installation Before installing PyEducate , please make sure to follow the requirements. \u2705 Requirements Python 3.9.2+ \ud83d\udcbb Windows OS (Cross-Platform has not been tested yet but is likely to work) Once you have all the requirements, you can safely install PyEducate using the steps below. \ud83d\udd27 Installation Download a released version (recommended for beginners).
